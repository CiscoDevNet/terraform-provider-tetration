  Resource for creating a role in Secure Workload (Tetration)
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "tetration_role" "role1" {
      app_scope_id = <ID_OF_SCOPE>
      access_app_scope_id = <ID_OF_SCOPE>
      name = "read_role"
      access_type = "scope_read"
      user_ids = ["<USER_IDS>"]
      description = "Demo description for role"
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
